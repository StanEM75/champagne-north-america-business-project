**1. Do you make profit today in North America?**. 
We are just about breaking even in certain years, but it’s fragile. Margins are lower than in France, mainly due to logistics costs and the margins taken by local distributors.  

**2. Are yearly sales volumes inferior, or even significantly inferior, to what you have in France?**. 
Yes, significantly inferior. But it’s not only a question of market size: I believe we are not taking full advantage of local opportunities, and our premium positioning is not always familiar or appealing to certain customer segments.

**3. Are sales volumes cyclical or seasonal?**. 
Yes, but I don’t have a clear picture. We can feel that end-of-year celebrations are strong, but beyond that, I can’t say for sure whether weddings, Valentine’s Day, or sporting events really boost sales.

**3bis. If yes, do you have historical data to quantify this cyclicality?**. 
We have several years of data, but it hasn’t been properly leveraged. Sales are recorded monthly, sometimes weekly, but there has been no in-depth analysis to identify precise patterns. The historical data is also not always consistent across sales channels.

**4. Are the products you sell in North America the same as in France?**. 
Overall, yes. We haven’t developed any specific range for the North American market, except for a few gift sets at Christmas. I sometimes feel that our bottle sizes don’t always match local consumption habits.

**4bis. Have you ever tried to launch products specifically for this market?**. 
Very few. Apart from the gift sets mentioned, we have mainly imported our range as is from France. For example, we haven’t tested smaller formats for single-glass sales or special cuvées for local events.

**5. Who are your competitors?**. 
Other French champagne houses, of course, but also Italian prosecco and local sparkling wine producers, especially in California. They are often more aggressive on pricing and better integrated into local distribution networks.

**5bis. Do you have access to data related to market shares or competitor presence?**. 
Not really. We sometimes access paid industry studies, but they are expensive and not always up to date. Our distributors probably have this information, but they do not systematically share it with us.

**6. Why don’t you know the precise moments when you could sell your products?**. 
Data is fragmented. Between what we receive from distributors, direct sales, and restaurant sales, it is difficult to have a consolidated view. We also haven’t really integrated local events into our analyses.

**6bis. Is internal data incomplete, fragmented, or unreliable?**. 
A bit of all three. Each channel (distributors, restaurants, e-commerce) has its own format and reporting frequency. There are sometimes duplicates, sometimes missing sales. The absence of a centralized system prevents us from having a clear and reliable overview at all times.

**7. What are your main difficulties aside from adapting to local events?**. 

Distribution – We depend too much on large distributors who impose their own rules.

Regulation – Alcohol advertising is highly regulated, which limits our marketing actions.

Exchange rates – Fluctuations have a strong impact on our margins.

Custom duties – They increase import costs and further reduce our net margins.
