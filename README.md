# champagne-north-america-business-project
This project is a simulation in which I provide business recommendations to a fictional French company selling champagne on the North American market.

---

## üçæ Context

**Company**: French champagne retailer, new to the North American market
**Market**: North America (USA & Canada)
**Main purpose**: Help the company adapt its product offering to this new market

The firm is only partially integrated into the North American business ecosystem, which puts it in a weak position when negotiating with distributors. This limits its ability to fully leverage the potential of its products with local consumers.

As a result, the company faces disappointing financial performance and struggles to collect reliable, actionable data to improve the situation. The market is highly competitive, and without a clear understanding of the target audience or a competitive product offering, the company‚Äôs position is unlikely to improve.
